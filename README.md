# Challange:

Show top news from the given api endpoint (link with api documentation is below). The user should be able to see the top news for the completed country GB or US. The news is presented as thumbnails (title, image and description).

Click on More> the user opens the news where the headline, image and content of the news are displayed. (country selection is disable). Content coming from the server is limited to 260 characters since we use a Developer account and that's fine.

In the Categories section, the user can see the top 5 news for certain categories that API allows (Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, Technology). You can click on the listed news for each category, after which the above-mentioned news layout opens. Each category can be clicked, after which the application should display all the news for the clicked category.

When he clicks on one of the categories, all the top news for that category are loaded (country selection is enabled and the user can change for which country he wants news from the category, eg science). Each category can expand / collapse and news are displayed in a row with an indicator if not all are visible. Clicking on the <or> indicator moves the news one position with the appropriate transition / animation of your choice.

The search section contains an input field in which the user can enter the term he wants to search in the top news. The page displays all news that meet the search criteria. (change of country made possible).

The solution of the task should be responsive. (Layout on smaller devices is left to the candidate on the mast).
